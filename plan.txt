Shippyar MVP Process & Secure Transaction Flow
Overview:
 Shippyar is a people-powered delivery marketplace that enables shoppers to purchase goods globally via trusted travelers. The following outlines a standard, professional MVP (Minimum Viable Product) user flow with integrated payment security and anti-fraud mechanisms.
________________


Step 1: Order Submission by Shopper
* Shopper pastes a product link (e.g., from Amazon).

* System automatically fetches item name, image, and price.

* Shopper enters:

   * Desired delivery destination and deadline.

   * Proposed delivery reward (percentage or fixed amount).

      * Order is published on the Shippyar marketplace.

________________


Step 2: Offers Submitted by Travelers
         * Verified travelers planning trips to the destination view orders.

         * Travelers submit offers indicating the delivery reward they expect.

         * Shopper reviews offers and selects one (based on price, profile, and reviews).

         * When an offer is accepted, the request enters the “Match” stage.

Step 3: Payment by Shopper (Before Chat is Enabled)
            * Shopper must pay the full amount before communicating with traveler:

               * Product price (e.g., $120)

               * Traveler reward (e.g., $7)

               * Shippyar platform fee (e.g., 5% or $6.35)

               * Total example: $133.35

                  * Funds are held in Shippyar’s Escrow system.

                  * Once payment is complete, private chat between traveler and shopper is unlocked.

Step 4: Secure Communication & Delivery
                     * Shopper and traveler coordinate delivery details in-app:

                        * Location, time, preferences

                           * Traveler purchases and carries the product.

                           * Shopper confirms receipt upon successful delivery.

                           * Shippyar releases funds from Escrow:

                              * Item reimbursement to traveler

                              * Delivery reward to traveler

                              * Platform fee retained by Shippyar
