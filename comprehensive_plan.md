## Project Overview

### Core Business Flow
1. **Order Submission**: Shopper pastes product link, system auto-fetches details
2. **Traveler Offers**: Verified travelers submit delivery offers
3. **Payment & Escrow**: Full payment before chat access, funds held in escrow
4. **Secure Communication**: In-app chat with content filtering
5. **Delivery & Release**: Funds released upon delivery confirmation

### Key Security Requirements
- No chat access before payment (prevent platform bypassing)
- Content filtering to block contact information sharing
- Escrow system to protect both parties
- User verification for travelers
- Comprehensive audit logging for financial transactions

## Critical Implementation Details

### 1. Escrow Payment Flow
```python
# Using Stripe Connect with delayed payouts
1. Shopper pays full amount (product + reward + fee)
2. Create payment intent with manual capture
3. Hold funds using Stripe's delayed payout (up to 90 days)
4. Unlock chat after successful payment
5. Release funds after delivery confirmation
6. Transfer reward to traveler's connected account
```

### 2. Chat Content Filtering
```python
# Regex patterns to block
- Phone numbers: r'\b\d{3}[-.]?\d{3}[-.]?\d{4}\b'
- Emails: r'\b[A-Za-z0-9._%+-]+@[A-Za-z0-9.-]+\.[A-Z|a-z]{2,}\b'
- URLs: r'http[s]?://(?:[a-zA-Z]|[0-9]|[$-_@.&+]|[!*\\(\\),]|(?:%[0-9a-fA-F][0-9a-fA-F]))+'
- Keywords: 'whatsapp', 'telegram', 'meet outside', 'off platform'
```

### 3. Order Matching Algorithm
```python
# Priority factors
1. Exact destination match
2. Delivery date compatibility
3. Traveler rating and verification status
4. Price competitiveness
5. Previous successful deliveries
```

### 4. Security Checkpoints
```yaml
Before Launch:
- [ ] JWT implementation with secure secrets
- [ ] Input validation on all endpoints
- [ ] Rate limiting configured
- [ ] HTTPS enforced
- [ ] Audit logging active

At Launch:
- [ ] Chat filtering tested
- [ ] Payment flow verified
- [ ] CSRF protection enabled
