3. **Geographic Intelligence**: PostGIS integration for location-based features
4. **Audit Trail**: Comprehensive logging for compliance and debugging
5. **Soft Deletes**: Data retention with privacy compliance
6. **Scalability**: Optimized indexes and partitioning strategies

### Technology Stack
- **Database**: PostgreSQL 15+ with extensions

notification_preferences -- Communication settings
```

**Key Features:**
- Dual role support (shopper/traveler/both)
- Email and phone verification
- Rating system for both roles
- Comprehensive audit trails
- GDPR-compliant soft deletes

### 2. Geographic Data
```sql
-- Location entities
countries               -- Standardized country data

```

**Key Features:**
- PostGIS integration for spatial queries
- Timezone support
- Distance calculations
- Route optimization support

### 3. Marketplace & Orders
```sql
-- Core marketplace
orders                 -- Product requests from shoppers
offers                 -- Proposals from travelers
order_status_history   -- Complete audit trail
```

**Key Features:**
- Product URL caching
- Flexible pricing model
- Deadline management
- Status workflow tracking
- International currency support

### 4. Financial System
```sql
-- Payment processing
payment_methods        -- User payment information (tokenized)
transactions          -- All financial transactions
escrow_holdings       -- Order payment escrow
```

**Key Features:**
- PCI-compliant tokenization
- Multi-currency support
- Escrow protection
- Platform fee calculation
- Comprehensive transaction logging

### 5. Communication System
```sql
-- Messaging
conversations         -- Chat between users
messages             -- Individual messages
```

**Key Features:**
- Access control (unlocked after payment)
- Multiple message types (text, image, location)
- Read/delivery status
- Content moderation support

### 6. Reviews & Trust
```sql
-- Trust system
reviews              -- User reviews and ratings
```

**Key Features:**
- Verified purchase requirements
- Dual-role rating system
- Content moderation
- Public/private review options

### 7. Compliance & Monitoring
```sql
-- Compliance
audit_logs                  -- System-wide audit trail
data_retention_policies     -- Automated cleanup rules
consent_records            -- GDPR consent tracking
security_incidents         -- Security event logging
```

## üîç Key Design Decisions

### 1. Dual-Role User Model
**Decision**: Single `users` table with `role` enum supporting multiple roles
**Reasoning**: 
- Simplifies user management
- Allows role transitions
- Maintains relationship integrity
- Supports future role expansion

```sql
CREATE TYPE user_role AS ENUM ('shopper', 'traveler', 'both', 'admin');
```

### 2. Order-Centric Architecture
**Decision**: Orders as the central entity connecting all marketplace activities
**Reasoning**:
- Clear transaction boundaries
- Simplifies data relationships
- Enables comprehensive audit trails
- Supports dispute resolution

### 3. Geographic Data Strategy
**Decision**: PostGIS with standardized country/city tables
**Reasoning**:
- Efficient spatial queries
- Standardized location data
- Distance calculations
- Route optimization support
- Timezone handling

### 4. Financial Security Design
**Decision**: Separate transactions table with escrow holdings
**Reasoning**:
- PCI compliance
- Clear money flow tracking
- Dispute resolution support
- Platform fee transparency

### 5. Soft Delete Strategy
**Decision**: `deleted_at` columns with filtered indexes
**Reasoning**:
- GDPR compliance (right to erasure)
- Data recovery capabilities
- Audit trail preservation
- Performance optimization

### 6. Audit Trail Implementation
**Decision**: Comprehensive audit logging with triggers
**Reasoning**:
- Regulatory compliance
- Debugging capabilities
- Security monitoring
- User activity tracking

## üöÄ Performance Optimizations

### 1. Indexing Strategy
```sql
-- Core performance indexes
CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY idx_orders_shopper ON orders(shopper_id) WHERE deleted_at IS NULL;
CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY idx_orders_status ON orders(status) WHERE deleted_at IS NULL;
CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY idx_cities_location ON cities USING GIST(location);
```

### 2. Query Optimization
- Filtered indexes on soft-deleted records
- Partial indexes for active data
- Full-text search with GIN indexes
- Spatial indexes for geographic queries

### 3. Partitioning Strategy (Future)
- Audit logs by month
- Notifications by date
- Transactions by year

## üîí Security & Compliance

### 1. Data Protection
- **Encryption**: Sensitive data encrypted at rest
- **Tokenization**: Payment methods tokenized
- **Access Control**: Row-level security policies
- **Audit Trails**: Comprehensive logging

### 2. GDPR Compliance
- **Right to Access**: Data export functions
- **Right to Rectification**: Correction workflows
- **Right to Erasure**: Anonymization procedures
- **Data Portability**: Machine-readable exports
- **Consent Management**: Granular consent tracking

### 3. Financial Compliance
- **PCI DSS**: Payment data tokenization
- **AML**: Transaction monitoring
- **Data Retention**: 7-year financial record retention
- **Audit Requirements**: Comprehensive transaction logging
